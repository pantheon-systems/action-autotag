A GitHub action that implements [autotag-dev/autotag](https://github.com/autotag-dev/autotag).

## What's it do?
This action will automatically create a new tag and release for your repository when a pull request is merged to the default branch. It will also create a changelog entry for the new tag and release.

Currently configuration is limited (see [source](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/action-autotag/blob/main/src/tag-release.sh)), but in future iterations more configuration options will be added.

This action is currently experimental.

## Inputs

### `gh-token`
A GitHub token with `repo` scope. This is used to create the tag and release.
